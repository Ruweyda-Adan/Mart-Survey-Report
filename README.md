## Survey Analysis Report
Welcome to the Survey Analysis Report repository.

This project analyzes customer feedback and purchasing behavior based on a survey dataset. The data was collected using Google Forms and analyzed using MySQL Workbench and Excel. Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the project uncovers valuable insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and product ratings. The findings provide actionable insights for businesses looking to improve customer satisfaction and optimize product offerings.

## Project Summary
This project simulates the type of analysis a business analyst or marketing researcher might perform when evaluating customer feedback and spending patterns. The survey dataset covers customer experiences, product purchases, and other relevant metrics. The project investigates:

Which age groups provide the highest ratings for products and services

The most and least money spent on products

Frequency of customer interest in promotions

Most frequently purchased products

Average total spending by visit frequency

Top products with the highest spending

The most common locations of customers

Suggestions for improvement from customers

Highest spenders by customer

The final deliverables include a detailed analysis report and a set of SQL queries that provide insights into customer preferences, spending behavior, and ratings trends.

## Objective
To clean, analyze, and visualize survey data in order to derive meaningful business insights using Excel and MySQL Workbench. The goal is to assist businesses in understanding customer behaviors, preferences, and areas for improvement.

## Chapters
## Chapter 1 Data Collection
The survey data was collected using Google Forms, allowing customers to provide feedback on their product purchases, experience, and other relevant information. This data was then imported into MySQL for further analysis.

## Chapter 2 Data Preparation & Cleaning (Excel)
Fixed inconsistencies in date formatting and monetary values

Standardized product names and customer ratings

Removed duplicates and prepared structured data for SQL import

## Chapter 2: Survey Data Analysis Queries (MySQL Workbench)
Performed key analytical queries such as:

Total spending per product category

Average ratings by age group

Frequency of promotion interest

Most commonly purchased products

Spending analysis by visit frequency

Key SQL Concepts Used:

SELECT, GROUP BY, COUNT, ORDER BY, JOIN, and SUM

## Chapter 3: Interactive Dashboard (Excel)
In this chapter, I focused on creating an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that would allow for a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the survey data. Using Excel, I was able to present the data in a way that allowed key trends, patterns, and findings to be easily accessible and interpretable. Excel's built-in tools for data visualization, such as pivot tables, charts, and slicers, enabled me to create a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard that facilitated quick insights into customer behavior and responses.

Lydia: Ksh 7,000.00

Aisha: Ksh 5,000.00

Billy: Ksh 3,000.00

## Problems Identified:

Customers who visit rarely or never spend less money, indicating lower engagement with the brand.

There's a strong interest in promotions, but some customers are undecided, which could be an area for better targeting or messaging.

## Solutions Suggested:

Offering more promotions or discounts to encourage those who are "maybe" interested in promotions.

Ensuring that high-value customers like "Ruu" and "Coco" continue to feel valued and engaged.

Addressing common suggestions such as "restock often" and "improve hygiene" to enhance overall customer satisfaction.
